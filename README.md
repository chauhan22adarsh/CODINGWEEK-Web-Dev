TASKS COMPLETED (as per CODING WEEK 2024)
Task 1

Replicate the image(similar to a blog website) given in HTML and CSS as much as you can. This
subtask could just be hardcoded up till now. The content of the news in the given image need not
be the same. You can use either dummy text or any other hypothetical strings.

Task 2

We have provided an api endpoint from where you can fetch all the data for each blog.
Below is how the response will look like.

API Endpoint

Web Development Task

 Fetch all the details by using the fetch API or any other library you want to use and render the
list to UI which you have created in the task$
 In the webpage sample we have sent, you can see 2 types of blogs:1) ones that are larger
and 2) ones that are on the right and in serial order. The content to be displayed in both of
them varies. For section 1: it will include headline, image, author, date, and type(out of which
“featured” is compulsory and the second type is mentioned in the API like “historical”/”cultural”
etc). For section 2: it only has the headline, image, and date$
 In section 2, the blogs in the API may exceed the blogs in the sample, so you must ensure
the scroll functionality in this section$
 You can use this website to get the different icons required. You can copy their SVG code and
paste it where it’s required$
 The navigation panel need not be functional but should have a hover effect on them$
 Now there are some things which if implemented could make you distinguishable from the
crowd. First is making the webpage responsive and second is, if we click any particular blog
then a box should appear which will contain the content of the blog. These additional tasks
are optional but if implemented, they can make a good impression of yours.;
 Note: The request is a GET request. Avoid spamming the API or your IP may be blocked for
spam.

Task 3

Website on your localhost is no fun. In this bonus task, you will host the website on the Internet!
You can host it anywhere you like (use any service) but if you have never hosted before, we
recommend you to use Github pages which makes it incredibly easy to host your static website.
Github pages
Successfully hosting the website on the internet will award you bonus marks so good luck :)
Note: Use only free hosting services. Do not pay for hosting. No need for paid domain.
